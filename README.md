# python3-starter
I learned to code in python3 couple months ago and generated these beauties.
 - The individual files generally contains codes related to one built-in python module.
 - The sub folders contains codes related to the python module of the same name as the folder name and usually contains multiple scripts in the sub folder.
 - If a sub folder contains only one script, then it is either necessary to highlight that corresponding python module or it is in progress.
 - Currently evaluating feasibility of adding separate README.md file for the important python modules.
